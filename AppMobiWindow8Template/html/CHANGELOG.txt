1.1 Release

This is *NOT* a drop in upgrade.  There are core CSS file changes for iOS native scrolling, so please do a merge/test locally before deploying.


Major notes

1) Native scrolling in iOS 5+

2) Chinese keyboard fixes for Android

3) JS scroller written/optimized

4) $().html() now has a second parameter "cleanup" that will dispatch a "destroy" event on notes (memory management).  jqUi uses this internally.

5) new $().asap() function for executing code instead of setTimeout

6) $.bind/$.trigger - bind and trigger events on JS objects instead of DOM nodes.  

7) touchLayer plugin - handles touch event dispatching and fixes for iOS and Android browsers.   This includes fast click and native scrolling/panning.
